# Jelly-Souls
Software Development group project 

My contribution was limited to the visual and gameplay aspect of the video game. The log in page was the responsibility of my other group mates and I worked with one other person on the visual and gameplay portion. His contribution was the implementation of the main character, the shooting mechanic, and the score counter. All other aspects were my doing. This includes collisions, enemies, game over, enemy spawning, etc.
